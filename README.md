## 🔥 Why ApiVault?

In professional Laravel applications (especially ERPs), managing consistent API responses can be repetitive. **ApiVault** solves this by:
- ✅ **Method Chaining:** A readable, developer-friendly way to build responses.
- ✅ **Auto-Pagination:** Detects Paginator instances and extracts meta-data automatically.
- ✅ **Smart Caching:** High-speed performance with page-aware caching (no more pagination conflicts).
- ✅ **Clean Architecture:** Keep your controllers slim and focused on logic.
